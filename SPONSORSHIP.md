Hi! I'm Manuel ðŸ˜„
I work as a Senior Software Developer at [@NearForm](https://github.com/nearform) on awesome stuff for our customers.

I contribute to Open Source Software (OSS) for 1 to 4 hours a day every weekday. _There is so much to do._
I use my vacation to get the time and focus on delivering new features to the community.

It is my choice to do so, but I must say that it is not always a pleasant job **triaging**, **explaining** and **helping** the community compared to working on a new cool module, upgrading my skills or just going out for a run.

<div align="center">If I helped you somehow, Iâ€™d appreciate your sponsorship or a one-time donation.</div>

## Communities

I help devs to learn something new by answering questions with detailed info, snippet and documentation.
By helping someone, I hope they will start helping others as a give-back recognition in a positive loop.

### Fastify

I'm mainly focused on **supporting** and **maintaining** the [@fastify](https://github.com/fastify) project through [+600 commit contributions](https://github.com/search?q=author%3AEomm+org%3Afastify&type=commits) and [+2k issue triage and PR reviews](https://github.com/search?q=commenter%3AEomm+org%3Afastify&type=issues).

### StackOverflow

I'm a StackOverflow [top user responder](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/fastify/topusers) and [the first user](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1454297/users-with-badges-for-skills?SkillName=fastify) getting the `fastify` badge on StackOverflow too.

### Node.js

I'm a fresh [Node.js contributor](https://github.com/search?q=author%3AEomm+org%3Anodejs+org%3Apkgjs&type=commits) aiming to find a way to support those packages that are broadly used (millions of download per week) but are not maintained.

## My most significant achievement

- The Fastify validation and serialization APIs
- Co-Author of the [Fastify book](https://www.packtpub.com/product/accelerating-server-side-development-with-fastify/9781800563582)
- The [`fastify-raw-body`](https://github.com/Eomm/fastify-raw-body) plugin
- The [`fastify-overview`](https://github.com/Eomm/fastify-overview) plugin _(it is now well known yet, check it out!)_

## How Sponsorship helps

I will continue to work to help the community grow up, but with your funds, I will be able to reach these goals:

- to establish a dedicated line with my sponsors to prioritize my OSS work
- to implement new features on OSS
- to keep me motivated and more present in the Fastify community by helping and serving
- to build new tools and fund domains to share with you
- to organize some OSS Events in local schools

Thanks for reading! Your sponsorship means a lot! âœ¨
