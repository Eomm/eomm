Hi! I'm Manuel ðŸ˜„  
I am a Senior Software Developer at [@NearForm](https://github.com/nearform) and work on awesome stuff for our customers.
I contribute to Open Source Software (OSS) but the time is never enough. _There is so much to do._

It is my choice to do:

- **triaging** more than [**1.1k**](https://github.com/search?q=involves%3Aeomm+org%3Afastify+is%3Aclosed&type=issues) issues
- **explaining** to [**2.7m**](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3309466/manuel-spigolon?tab=profile) developers
- **helping** the community with [**2.1k**](https://github.com/search?q=involves%3Aeomm+org%3Afastify&type=pullrequests) reviews
- **improving** the Fastify ecosystem with [**+500**](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Aeomm+org%3Afastify+is%3Aclosed&type=pullrequests) pull requests

It is not always a pleasant job compared to working on new cool toys, working hard to get a promotion, or just going out for a run.

<div align="center">If I helped you somehow, Iâ€™d appreciate your sponsorship or a one-time donation.</div>

## Fastify

I mainly focus on **supporting** and **maintaining** the [@fastify](https://github.com/fastify) project.  
I'm the [3rd most active contributor](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/graphs/contributors) of all time.

I help devs to learn something new by answering questions with detailed info, snippets and documentation.
By helping someone, I hope they will start helping others as a give-back recognition in a positive loop.

In the StackOverflow ranking I'm a [top user responder](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/fastify/topusers) and [the first user](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1454297/users-with-badges-for-skills?SkillName=fastify) getting the `fastify` badge too.

## How Sponsorship helps

After more than 5 years of commitment to Open Source, I need your help to find a new purpose.
The community is growing, but I can't keep up while working for free.

I spent almost every weekend for two years writing the [Fastify book](https://backend.cafe/the-fastify-book-is-out).
I receive numerous requests for a Fastify video course or new paid training courses.

I am not satisfied with those formats because _they are not suitable for everyone_.
While writing the Fastify book, I learned that creating high-quality content requires significant time.
For these reasons, to keep my focus on the community, consider sponsoring me.

Transform your desire to contribute to Open Source into impact âœ¨ by sponsoring me ðŸ’¸
